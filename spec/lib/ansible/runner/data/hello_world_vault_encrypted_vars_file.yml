# with the correct password the message displayed should be:
#
#   "Hello World! vars_file_1=vars_file_1_value, vars_file_2=vars_file_2_value"
#
# This file was generated by running the following:
#
#   $ cp vars_file.yml vault_encrypted_vars_file.yml
#   $ ansible-vault encrypt vault_encrypted_vars_file.yml
#   New Vault password:
#   Confirm New Vault password:
